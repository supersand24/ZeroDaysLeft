# ZeroDaysLeft

Main Concept

The game will be a looter shooter, focusing on realism gunplay, while keeping an arcadic feel with the artstyle and fictional themes.  The player will be allowed to select their loadout, with items from their stash back at home.  The goal is to get Food, Water, Gas, and Ammo for everyone back home, these items will disappear at a later to be determined rate.  Dying in this game will be a common event.  You will respawn as another settler back at home.  Progress will be reset, if no more settlers are left.  The player will be able to choose a location to go to, and have a list of possible entrances, and extracts.  Not all extracts and entrances will be available at all times.  It is also possible hidden extracts will be found.

Gameplay

When entering the map, the game can take a silent approach(this will be very hard) or a loud one.  As the player explores the map, they will find different blockades such as, a locked door, a chained door, or a pile of debris.  Killing/alerting  enemies, spawns more enemies, this will keep the feel of endless gameplay.  Large hoards will come through, and you will potentially have to defend one area, having a radio to homebase will be helpful to warn the player.  Players will be able to place objects, such as turrets, auto mag loaders, etc.

Hand Actions

Both hands will be able to do actions, for example, removing the left hand to start reload, or rechamber a bolt action sniper, dropping a grenade, etc.

Reloading Mechanics

The player can choose to have a 20 round mag and 3 30 round mags in their inventory if they so choose.  Reloading will ask the player which mag they want to choose, no choice, just picks the next one in line.  Choosing a mag, perhaps be with scroll wheel or arrow keys, when the inventory shows up.  The player can mark the next mag in their inventory if they so choose.

Multiplayer

When joining a friends game, each player can pull from their own settlement, or borrow other players' loot and settler, if allowed.  The logistics for multiplayer will be complex, each player will have a different entrance, and PvP will be possible, to the player's discretion.
